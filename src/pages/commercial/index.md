    - text: Radon is a harmful gas that is found throughout Wyoming.  People often
        test their homes for radon, but many people spend as much time in the
        workplace as their homes, and could be at risk for radon toxicity there
        too.  We offer state-of-the-art active radon detection, which provides
        rapid, real-time, and accurate results.
